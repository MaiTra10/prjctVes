Welcome to the Github repository for prjctVes. It is a Discord bot which utilizes the [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/) Python module to create a bot that sends and receives messages via Discord. 

Along with this, the bot makes use of a custom REST API which you could learn more about [here](https://github.com/MaiTra10/prjctVes-API).

prjctVes allows you to keep track of up to 10 CS:GO items and 10 stocks in a watchlist and features detailed looks at their current price and trends. It also has a search feature which allows you to search for any CS:GO item or stock. 

The inspiration for this project was that I noticed I would wake up every day and default to searching a few CS:GO items and stocks to see their price fluctuation, so I thought why not create a bot to automate this process and make it possible to get all the items/stocks from a single Discord command.
