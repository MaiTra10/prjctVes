Welcome to the Github repository for prjctVes. It is a Discord bot which utilizes the [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/) Python module to design a bot to send and receive messages via Discord. 

Along with this, it is equipped with a [REST API](https://github.com/MaiTra10/prjctVes-API) I developed using the AWS API Gateway and Lambda functions to allow it to communicate with a DynamoDB table and web scrape price data of Steam Market items and stocks through the use of the [BeautifulSoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) Python library.
